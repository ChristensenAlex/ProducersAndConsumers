# ProducersAndConsumers

This program models a producer and consumer who add and remove from a buffer respectively. This code, while useless, shows a backbone that could be modfied into a concurrent program. I would like to thank Mr and Miss Arpaci-Dusseau who wrote Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces. This code mirrors an example described in the chapter on Condition Variables.
